/*
The selected code snippet is a React functional component named `PublicLayout`. This component is designed to be used as a layout for public routes in an application. It checks if a user is already authenticated by looking for a "token" cookie. If the cookie exists, the component redirects the user to the home page ("/") using the `navigate` function from `react-router-dom`. If the cookie is not found, the component renders its children components as is.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- Line 2: The `Cookies` object from the `js-cookie` library is imported.
- Line 3: The `useEffect` hook from React is imported.
- Line 4: The `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` is imported.
- Line 6: The `PublicLayout` function is defined, which takes a single prop `children` of type `React.ReactNode`.
- Line 7: The `navigate` function is destructured from the `useNavigate` hook.
- Line 8: The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects. Inside the effect, a check is made to see if a "token" cookie exists using `Cookies.get("token")`.
- Line 9: If a "token" cookie is found, the `navigate` function is called to redirect the user to the home page ("/").
- Line 11: The component returns a `<div>` element containing its children components.

This code ensures that public routes are only accessible to users who are not authenticated.

/*
What happens if the 'token' cookie is not found in the selected code snippet?
If the 'token' cookie is not found in the selected code snippet, the `PublicLayout` component will render its children components as is. This is because the `useEffect` hook is set up to run only once (when the component mounts) and checks for the existence of the 'token' cookie. If the cookie is not found, the `navigate` function is not called, and the component proceeds to render its children components.

In other words, if a user is not authenticated (i.e., does not have a 'token' cookie), the `PublicLayout` component will allow them to access the public routes and render the specified children components.
